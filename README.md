# Generating abstract art using DCGAN

The goal of this project is to train a DCGAN to generate new works of abstract art. The implementation will be done in PyTorch. 

This project will utilze the model proposed by the 2015 paper "UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS", which advocates the idea of using strided convolution to replace pooling layers.
